// Explanation of the Node structure
/*
    The 'struct Node' serves as a blueprint for each node in a linked list. 

    Components:
    1. **Data (int data)**: This is the actual data the node will hold, in this case, an integer.
    
    2. **Pointer (Node* next)**: This pointer points to the next node in the linked list. 
       When thereâ€™s no next node (end of the list), 'next' is set to nullptr.

    This Node structure enables creating a dynamic linked list where each node can point to another, 
    allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal through the list.

    // Creating the first node with data value 10
    Node* firstNode = new Node(10); // Dynamically allocating memory for the first node
    cout << "Data in first node: " << firstNode->data << endl;

    // Memory cleanup
    delete firstNode; // Deleting the dynamically allocated node to prevent memory leaks

    return 0; // Return statement indicating successful completion of the program
