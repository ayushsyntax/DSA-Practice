# DSA Practice

A dedicated space for my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey. This repository documents my learning path, primarily inspired by Striver's DSA Sheet, while integrating my own methods and strategies.

## About

- **Learning Resource:** Striver's DSA Sheet
- **Approach:** Combining structured learning from Striverâ€™s insights with personalized problem-solving techniques and explorations.

## Contents

1. **Arrays and Strings**
2. **Linked Lists**
3. **Stacks and Queues**
4. **Trees and Graphs**
5. **Dynamic Programming**
6. **Sorting and Searching**
7. **Miscellaneous Topics**

Each folder contains practice problems, solutions, and notes to reinforce my understanding.

## Goals

- Strengthen problem-solving skills with hands-on coding.
- Build a solid foundation in core data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare efficiently for technical interviews.
