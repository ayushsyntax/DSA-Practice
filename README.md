# DSA-Practice
I am actively working on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to enhance my problem-solving skills. My primary resource is the Striver DSA Sheet, which provides a structured collection of coding problems.

Focus Areas:
Fundamentals: Mastering key data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching).
Techniques: Exploring dynamic programming, recursion, and backtracking.
Problem Solving: Regularly solving categorized problems from the Striver DSA Sheet to track my progress and refine my coding skills.
Collaboration: Engaging with peers for discussions and code reviews to enhance learning.
Through consistent practice and exploration, I aim to build a strong foundation in DSA for my future endeavors in programming and data science.
